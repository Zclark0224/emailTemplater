            I am {firstName} {lastName}’s math teacher.  I wanted to update you on the progress{firstName} has made in class. {firstName} has recently been having troubles in class.  I have noticed that {firstName} is having a hard time controlling their behavior and maintaining attention on the math lesson.  I have started to see how their behavior could begin to effect their grade and would like to prevent this.  Please reach out to me when you are able to set up a time to talk about this more.
